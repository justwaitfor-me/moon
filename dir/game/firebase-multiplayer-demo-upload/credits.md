#Credits

##I would like to give credit to Drew Conley for his tutorial on YouTube which helped me in developing my web game. The tutorial provided me with a solid understanding of multiplayer game development with Firebase.

I used large parts of Drew Conley's code in my game and I am grateful for his contribution.
